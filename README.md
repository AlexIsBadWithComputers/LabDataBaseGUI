# LabDataBaseGUI
This is where I back up the GUI that organizes the database I've made for the lab. 

Notes:

1. If you're using this you've either broken the lab copy or you're doing oddly specific similar research. Cudos!

2. This searches for ASCII grid exports of type *.exp from the THERMO-NEPTUNE Data Evaluation Software, so if you don't have that it's not going to find any files

3. I'll make an instruction manual eventually.
